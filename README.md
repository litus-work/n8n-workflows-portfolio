# 📁 n8n Workflows Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of advanced and practical n8n workflow automations I've built. Each folder contains one workflow with documentation and usage instructions.

## 📦 Projects
### [AI Mail Sender (Cold Outreach Automation)](./ai-mail-sender)
This workflow generates and sends personalized cold emails based on customer profiles. It uses AI to tailor content and Google Sheets to store results. Ideal for soft B2B consulting outreach.

### [Telegram Dialog Extractor](https://github.com/litus-work/n8n-Telegram-Dialogs-Extractor)
Parses exported Telegram chat history (ZIP with messages.html and voice files). Extracts messages, voice transcriptions, sorts and formats the conversation into clean JSON for later use.

### [Google Maps Email Scraper](./maps-emails-scraper)
Automates data scraping from Google Maps results. Extracts website domains from HTML, follows to pages, and finds emails using regex. Helpful for building B2B contact lists.

### [AI-Powered Slideshow + Video Creator](./ai-slideshow-video-creator)
Creates slideshows from text ideas using AI-generated images and text. Final result is exported as a video, ideal for content creation workflows or presentations.

### [AI Sheet Flow (Summarizer & Insight Extractor)](./ai-sheet-flow)
Reads a Google Sheet row-by-row and uses an AI agent to extract insights, write summaries, or generate email texts. Works with Groq LLM API and integrates with LangChain Agent in n8n.
